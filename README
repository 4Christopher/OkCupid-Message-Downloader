The time has come to deactivate my OkCupid account, but I was slightly unhappy about leaving all my messages in a locked silo, as they contained a nontrivial amount of emotionally significant correspondence. I googled around a bit for scripts that other people had written to do this, and found one "written for Greasemonkey":http://mkay.saverpigeeks.com/FetchOK.xhtml and another "written in Java":http://mkay.saverpigeeks.com/FetchOK.xhtml, but neither seemed to be recent enough to reflect the current OkC HTML.

I prefer the "BeautifulSoup":http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ Python library for dealing with HTML, so decided to write my own. *Find it here! Use it quickly* to download and archive your own messages! Because I probably won't update it as the site updates.
